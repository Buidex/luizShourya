    <img class="fit-picture" src="img/peter.png">
    <p> It seems today, that all you see is violence in movies, <br />
        and sex on T.V.<br />
        But where are those good old-fashioned values,<br />
        on which we used to rely?<br />
        It used to be, a big time star was elegant as Garbo,<br />
        or Hedy Lamarr.<br />
        But now we get like Jenny Lopez,<br />
        you want to curl up and die.<br />
        Lucky theres a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/">Family Guy</a>.<br />
        Lucky theres a man who positively can do<br />
        all the things that make us-<br />
        Laugh and cry!<br />
        He's a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/">Family Guy</a>!</p><br />

    <ul>
